  One YML file can mixin another YML file.
  This will make it inherit all properties from the other YML file,
  including tasks, tags, env, env_files, PATH directories, etc.
mixin:

  KEY_2: value_child_2
  KEY_3: value_child_3
  PATH: path_child

  task2:
    cmd: echo child says $KEY_2
  task3:
    cmd: echo child says $KEY_3
  path:
